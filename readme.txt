== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to wrap menu link text in `span` html element =

Where you show your menu with function `<?php wp_nav_menu(); ?>` as param you can add `array('link_before' => '<span>', 'link_after' => '</span>')`.
It makes css markup easier.

= How to add another size for the image? =

To add a new size (or remove an old one) add a function to the `menu-image-sizes` filter. For example

```
<?php
add_filter( 'menu-image-sizes', function($sizes){

  // remove the default 36x36 size
  unset($sizes['menu-36x36'];

  // add a new size
  $sizes['menu-50x50'] = array(50,50);

  // return $sizes (required)
  return $sizes;

});
?>
```
